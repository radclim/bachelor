# Limbo Frontend Boilerplate

To work on the Limbo Frontend Boilerplate contents, make sure to run the command `cd frontend` to navigate to the /frontend folder.

### Starting a New Project from the Boilerplate

When starting a new project from the boilerplate, copy the /frontend folder (and **only** the /frontend folder with all its contents) to the new solution's repository. The /frontend folder should exist as a folder in the root of the repository. **Do not extract the contents of the /frontend folder to the root of the repository!**

## Differences from Earlier Boilerplates

This boilerplate is derived from the [nuxt-boilerplate (v5)](https://github.com/limbo-works/nuxt-boilerplat) and therefore lend a general structure from there. But in general a lot has been changed (and trimmed down).
